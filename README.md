# Odin Project Clone

This repository is part of the "Design Your Own Grid-based Framework" which is the last project in the Microverse's HTML & CSS3 Course. It consists of building our own grid-based framework and use it clone any website. We based our framework in the Bootstrap framework and choose to clone [The Odin Project website](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

## Technologies used

In this project we used HTML and CSS, the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) syntax for the preprocessor [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) , [Font Awesome v5.11.2](https://fontawesome.com/changelog/latest) and our own grid-based framework.
